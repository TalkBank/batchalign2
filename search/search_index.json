You must supply a language code flag: <code>--lang=[three letter ISO language code]</code> for the ASR system to know what language the transcript is in. You can choose the flags <code>--rev</code> to use Rev.AI, a commercial ASR service, or <code>--whisper</code>, to use a local copy of OpenAI Whisper. For more information on our Rev.ai integration, see this page.</li> <li><code>align</code> - by placing both an audio of video file (<code>.mp3/.mp4/.wav</code>) and an utterance-aligned CHAT file in the input directory, this function recovers utterance-level time alignments (if they are not already annotated) and generates word-level alignments. The @Languages header in the CHAT file tells the program which language is in the transcript.</li> <li><code>morphotag</code> - by placing a CHAT file in the input directory, this function uses Stanford NLP Stanza to generate morphological and dependency analyses.
