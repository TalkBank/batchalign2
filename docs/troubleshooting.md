# Troubleshooting 

Hello! Here we collect some common troubleshooting tips when Batchalign doesn't work. **Many of these tips are for *OLDER* versions of Batchalign, and your best bet is probably to [install with the new instructions](index.md#install-and-update-the-package)** and everything will likely just work.

## Start Troubleshooting
First, to confirm your error, run Batchalign in debug mode:

```bash
batchalign -vvvv [verb] [arguments]
```

for instance:

```bash
batchalign -vvvv align ~/ba_data/input ~/ba_data/output
```

If you encounter an error, identify the **last line** of the Batchalign error output. It should usually be some coloured text placed *after* the big red box outlining the error location. It usually is shaped `[Something]Error: [error message]`. 

Once you have done this, scroll down to the matching error type to learn more.

## Tips

### ConnectTimeout

```python
ConnectionTimeout: (MaxRetryError("HTTPSConnectionPool(host='[some website]')")
```

where `some website` is usually `huggingface.co` or `api.rev.ai`. 

This means we cannot reach the serversâ€”the former, Huggingface, for model serving and the latter, Rev.AI, for ASR. Ensure those websites are accessible from the device where you are running Batchalign + also for your institution.

### `pip: command not found` or `pip3: command not found`
It is unfortunately difficult for us to provide a general command for installation that works across all systems. If your system reports either `pip` or `pip3` as not found, and you are sure *Python below 3.11 and above 3.8* is installed, try the other `pip` command. For instance, if you used `pip`, try using `pip3`.

### `batchalign: command not found` on Windows
Try using 

```
py -m batchalign [verb] [args]
```

like:

```
py -m batchalign align ~/ba_data/input ~/ba_data/output
```

### Get Pip on Windows
Run the following commands:

- `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py | python`
- `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python`

Optionally, you can additionally add the path to your environment so that you can use `pip` anywhere. It's somewhere like `C:\Python33\Scripts`.
